	<h1> Abour Hour of Code</h1>

	<p>Our preparation for the Hour of Code event
           Hour of Code event is a global movement. This event reaches millions of students in 80 + countries all around the world. It is meant to show that everyone can learn to program. This is held every December since 2013. During this event include one-hour codding activities. This year we are planning to organize this event as a team. It was a little bit hard for us because we had difficulties finding the school. We can not use Sahil’s school because we could not get approval and the location was not convenient. Then Farid said we can use his school because he had good relations with teachers and the principal. But they wanted us to bring documents from ADA University. In the end thanks to Murad we found a school to host our event. Our school is 276 №. This school was established in 1986 and won “The School of Year” in 2012. We met a couple of times after finding school and we are still working on planning our event. We have some ideas such as printing and giving special certificates to students who will participate in our event. We are planning to organize our event on 10th December..</p>

	<h1> Our Website</h1>

	<p> Building our team website: First, we each studied HTML and CSS fundamentals individually. Because the most basic requirements for developing a website include HTML, CSS, and codes, as well as programming languages such as Java Script. Then, at university, we gathered together to decide on a logo, a slogan, and a team name. We collaborated on the website's design, text content, and images while preparing our content. Rufa and Chichak worked on the logo, while Hikmat and Jamil used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the website.</p>
